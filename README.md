Once upon a time, I enjoyed playing Gran Turismo 3 with a controller. Then a bunch of stuff happened. Here is how the sim rig has evolved over time.

## Version 0.0

Timeline: 0 AD -> 2003, maybe?

Mood: it'd be cool to play Gran Turismo every once in a while.

PC:
* Not a PC. PS2
* Gran Turismo 3

## Version 1.0

Timeline: 2003, maybe? -> December 2017

Mood: it'd be cool to play Gran Turismo with a wheel every once in a while.

Sim rig:
* Logitech Driving Force GT bought used from Craigslist
* Computer desk

PC:
* Nah PS3

## Version 2.0: Still a filthy casual

Timeline: December 2017-November 2019

Mood: it'd be cool to play iRacing every once in a while.

PC (preexisting): 
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Radeon HD 5750 (2009-era)
* Bunch of random platter hard drives
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

Sim rig:
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* Coffee table + extra wood for mounting

## Version 2.1

Mood: Hey, I want to get back into autocrossing on the regular. I should set up a better rig so that I can do more iRacing in the offseason.

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* [+] Radeon RX580
* [+] Some SSD + brackets
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* [+] Wheelstand pro, but for a different wheel. Like, not the T300RS.
* [+] Ikea kid's chair
* [+] Some dining room chair (wayfair?)
* [+] a block of wood in front of the rear chair legs or something so the pedals wouldn't move that much

### Images:

## Version 3.0: The SimRiggening

Mood: I'm sick of my pedals moving so much. I should get something that is more rigid. 

What I thought I'd buy: Playseat, maybe a Simetik K2
What I actually bought: SimLab GT1 Evo

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* [+] SimLab GT1 Evo
* [+] SimLab single monitor mount 
* [+] NRG FRP310 seat

## Version 3.1: moar pixels

Mood: This rig is nice, but my monitor hookup is pretty hokey and it would be nice to accessorize. I don't think I'll ever get triples.

What I thought I'd buy: 34" ultrawide 
What I actually bought: 34" ultrawide (LG 34UM69G-B)

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)
* [+] LG 34UM69G-B

## Version 3.1.1: lol jk

Mood: Ah fuck, the 34" LG doesn't really mount correctly to this SimLab single monitor mount. 

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] LG 34UM69G-B
* [+] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

## Version 3.2: totally not doing triples but you never know

Mood: I'll return it and buy a single 32". I doubt I'm ever going to go triples but a 32" covers my bases in case I change my mind. 
Mood2: Shopping for monitors is fucking hard.

What I then actually bought: 32" AOC CQ32G1

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

## Version 3.3: Accessorize!

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets

* [+] SimLab Caster wheels
* [+] SimLab Cup holder


## Version 3.4: I mean I might do triples I guess

Mood: OK, I don't think I'm going to get triples any time soon, but I probably will eventually. I should just buy the triple stand now, because SimLab is getting backordered really quickly, and that way I'm covered whenever I want to upgrade. Also, it will make it easier if the monitor is on the standalone mount.

What I bought: triple mount

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets

* Sparco Seat slider
* Simlab Keyboard Tray
* SimLab Speaker brackets
* SimLab Caster wheels
* SimLab Cup holder

## Version 4.0: Fancy parts start here

Mood: I'm hearing a lot about load cell pedals. These T300RS pedals aren't that great. I'll see about the Fanatec V3s.

What I thought I'd buy: Fanatec V3s
What I actually bought: Heusinkveld Sprints, because the V3s sold out really quickly.

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives

## Version 6.0

Mood: People with G25s are kicking my ass on a T300RS! I need a DD wheel. So that I can get more of a workout when people with G25s kick my ass. Which will continue to happen because I don't practice enough. Also, I want a fourth monitor so that when I spin into the grass, I know when to rejoin without murdering someone.

Mount: 
* I started with the SimLab direct drive mount
* I changed the orientation of the bars from vertical to horizontal for more knee room

### Wheel 1: convert the T300RS

Why: I already have the T300, so it's sort of free.
What I bought: SimRacingCoach Thrustmaster-to-OSW adapter, the wrong quick release

![on the bottom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/rev6x.jpg)

https://github.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/blob/main/rev6x.jpg

### Wheel 2: rally wheel

Why: I play a lot of DiRT 2.0 and I want something proper rally size.

Attempt 1:
* OMP WRC. 350mm - too big. 

Attempt 2: 
* Sparco R383. 330mm, just right. 

### Wheel 3: GT wheel

Why: TCR, GT3, GTE.

What:
* NSH Racing BLE Sport wireless button box
* Motamec D-shape 320mm wheel

## MK next

Mood: I have no complaints about my setup, except it's just really dark. Everything is black.

What I did: painted seat orange at a local body shop

### Wheel 4: GT wheel, but again

Why: another button broken on the NSH Racing box. Also, the people who touch SimCore button boxes seem to love them.

What:
* Sparco P310
* SimCore SDT24-WS

Notes:
* I had to do a lot of thinking ahead of time to figure out what buttons hsould do what
