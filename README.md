# My sim rig evolution, aka "how deep does the rabbit hole go"

![It's deep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/3HeH.gif)

Once upon a time, I enjoyed playing Gran Turismo 3 with a controller. Then a bunch of stuff happened. Here is how the sim rig has evolved over time.

You may notice a cluster of purchases in April 2020. That's right around when it became clear that autocross season was effectively canceled. 

## I don't want to read all this noise, despite the charming and snarky tone. What lessons did you learn that other people can use?

* Skip to the good stuff. You'll save money in the long term. 
 * I went straight to the Heusinkvelds when I decided to get serious and that turned out great.
 * I bought a cheaper wireless SC2 button box (NSH racing) at the beginning. It did not turn out great. Not terrible, it was fine, but it's not a button box I will want to keep forever.
* Consider whether you really want direct drive. One of the things I like about it is basically infinite wheel choice (there aren't a lot of options in the Thrustmaster universe). But even on an SC2 Sport, I'm never using 100% of the force. If I had to go back to the T300RS wheelbase/wheel, I'd be fine. 
* Simucube 2 wireless has been 100% reliable for me so far.

## Version 0.0

Timeline: 0 AD -> 2003, maybe?

Mood: it'd be cool to play Gran Turismo every once in a while.

PC:
* Not a PC. PS2
* Gran Turismo 3

## Version 1.0

Timeline: 2003, maybe? -> December 2017

Mood: it'd be cool to play Gran Turismo with a wheel every once in a while.

Sim rig:
* Logitech Driving Force GT bought used from Craigslist
* Computer desk

PC:
* Nah PS3

## Version 2.0: Still a filthy casual

Timeline: December 2017-November 2019

Mood: it'd be cool to play iRacing every once in a while.

PC (preexisting): 
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Radeon HD 5750 (2009-era)
* Bunch of random platter hard drives
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

Sim rig:
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* Coffee table + extra wood for mounting

## Version 2.1

Mood: Hey, I want to get back into autocrossing on the regular. I should set up a better rig so that I can do more iRacing in the offseason.

Timeline: November 2019 -> January 2020

PC:

* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives

* [+] Ikea kid's chair
* [+] Some dining room chair (wayfair?)
* [+] a block of wood in front of the rear chair legs or something so the pedals wouldn't move that much

### Images:

## Version 3.0: The SimRiggening

Mood: I'm sick of my pedals moving so much. I should get something that is more rigid. 

Timeline: January 2020 -> April 2020

What I thought I'd buy: 
* Playseat, maybe a Simetik K2

What I actually bought: 
* SimLab GT1 Evo

PC:

## Version 3.1: moar pixels

Mood: This rig is nice, but my monitor hookup is pretty hokey and it would be nice to accessorize. I don't think I'll ever get triples. Time to get working on my autocross car since I have all this downtime now.

Timeline: April 2020

What I thought I'd buy: 
* 34" ultrawide 
What I actually bought: 
* 34" ultrawide (LG 34UM69G-B)

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)
* [+] LG 34UM69G-B

## Version 3.1.1: lol jk

Mood: Ah fuck, the 34" LG doesn't really mount correctly to this SimLab single monitor mount. Like I could probably make it work with some adapters, but nah.

Timeline: April 2020

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] LG 34UM69G-B
* [+] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)

## Version 3.2: totally not doing triples but you never know

Mood: 
* I'll return it and buy a single 32". I doubt I'm ever going to go triples but a 32" covers my bases in case I change my mind. 

Mood2: 
* Shopping for monitors is fucking hard.

Timeline: April 2020

What I then actually bought: 32" AOC CQ32G1

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* [-] 26" Samsung TV/monitor (that doesn't have proper VESA mounts because reasons)
* [+] AOC CQ32G1

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* SimLab GT1 Evo
* SimLab single monitor mount 
* NRG FRP310 seat

## Version 3.3: Accessorize!

Mood: This thing is turning into spaghetti. I need to start organizing. And cable managing. I mean, sort of. Also, beer.

Timeline: April 2020

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* AOC CQ32G1

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* SimLab GT1 Evo
* SimLab single monitor mount 
* NRG FRP310 seat
* [+] ~~SimLab~~ Sparco Seat slider
* [+] Simlab Keyboard Tray
* [+] SimLab Speaker brackets
* [+] SimLab Caster wheels
* [+] SimLab Cup holder

## Version 3.4: I mean I might do triples I guess

Mood: OK, I don't think I'm going to get triples any time soon, but I probably will eventually. I should just buy the triple stand now, because SimLab is getting backordered really quickly, and that way I'm covered whenever I want to upgrade. Also, it will make it easier if the monitor is on the standalone mount (as opposed to the integrated which forces certain geometry and doesn't deal with triples > 32" without modifications).

Timeline: April 2020

What I bought: triple mount

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 8 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives

* NRG FRP310 seat
* Sparco Seat slider
* Simlab Keyboard Tray
* SimLab Speaker brackets
* SimLab Caster wheels
* SimLab Cup holder

## Version 4.0: Fancy parts start here

Mood: I'm hearing a lot about load cell pedals. These T300RS pedals aren't that great. I'll see about the Fanatec V3s.

What I thought I'd buy: 
* Fanatec V3s

What I actually bought: 
* Heusinkveld Sprints, because the V3s sold out really quickly. Buy once, cry once, right?

Timeline: April 2020

PC:

## Version 4.2

Mood: 
* it'd be cool to have a shifter. Hey, the Fanatec looks cool. I can go manual or sequential!

Mood2: 
* Dirt Rally is pretty awesome. I want a handbrake so I can stop using the circle button on my T300RS wheel.

Timeline: May 2020 - July 2020

* What I thought I'd buy: Fanatec SSQ 1.5
* What I ordered: Fanatec SSQ 1.5

## Version 5.0

Mood: I want triples. Also, ACC is pretty cool, but my PC pretty much sucks. Playing single screen 1080p ACC with 70% resolution scaling is basically like playing Gran Turismo 2.

![cable management sucks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/rev50.jpg)

Coming out of this, iRacing ran fine at triple 1440p with some details turned down but ACC and DiRT were less comfortable so I was running them at triple 1080p.

## Version 6.0

Mood: People with G25s are kicking my ass on a T300RS! I need a DD wheel. So that I can get more of a workout when people with G25s kick my ass. Which will continue to happen because I don't practice enough. Also, I want a fourth monitor so that when I spin into the grass, I know when to rejoin without murdering someone.

Timeline: September 2020 - November 2020

Mount: 
* I started with the SimLab direct drive mount
* I changed the orientation of the bars from vertical to horizontal for more knee room
* I ended up wanting more angle and bought the HRS bracket to use with the SimLab profile

PC:
* AMD Ryzen5 3600 processor

## Version 6.1: bling

Mood: I have no complaints about my setup, except it's just really dark. Everything is black.

Timeline: November 2020 - present

What I did: painted seat orange at a local body shop

![Now with SimCore](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/PXL_20210228_234524911.jpg)

## Epilogue: Am I done now?

No.


## Appendix: Wheel collection

### Wheel 1: convert the T300RS

Why: I already have the T300, so it's sort of free.
What I bought: SimRacingCoach Thrustmaster-to-OSW adapter, the wrong quick release

Purchased September 2020

![on the bottom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/rev6x.jpg)

https://github.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/blob/main/rev6x.jpg

Review: This was fine and it got me through the initial period where I was waiting for button boxes to be in stock. I disassembled it and put the T300RS setup back the way it was so that the kiddos can use it on the PS4.

### Wheel 2: rally wheel: Sparco R383 + SimLine button box

Why: I play a lot of DiRT 2.0 and I want something round + proper rally size.

Purchased September 2020

Attempt 1:
* OMP WRC. 350mm - too big. 

Attempt 2: 
* Sparco R383. 330mm, just right. 

Review: I started out with just a wheel + the Simucube quick release because DiRT doesn't need very many buttons. I ended up purchasing a button box from SimLine. SimLine has a few ready-made type button boxes - a Fiesta WRC, a Porsche GT, and an Audi R8 GT3. They can also do custom wheels including funky switches and Simucube wireless. I had a button box made with only a handful of buttons, one funky switch (mostly for menus) and SC2 wireless. It's awesome! The paddles are better than the NSH though they are not amazeballs like the SimCore paddles. Buttons are good. And the value is excellent. The only thing I'd change is possibly ordering the Fiesta WRC button box in wireless instead because it looks great. (Though even in DiRT most of those buttons would not have jobs, I think)

You can find them on Facebook here: https://www.facebook.com/simline.gt/

### Wheel 3: GT wheel: NSH Racing + Motamec D shape

Why: TCR, GT3, GTE.

What:
* NSH Racing BLE Sport wireless button box
* Motamec D-shape 320mm wheel

Purchased September 2020

![yellow at first](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/activeyawcontrol/simrig-evolution/main/rev6x2.jpg)

Review: This button box was.. fine. They messed up my order at first (wrong color, and they forgot the SQR) and then the box was damaged in shipping (funky switch broken). They got a replacement out pretty fast. On the replacement box, no issues other than the headlight button stopped working. The paddles are fine but I think the SimCore ones have ruined me. One thing about this box - while I don't think I'd buy another one, I really like the layout, even compared to the SimCore. There are dedicated dials for a lot of different functions, which each get their own labels. This is easier to work with than mapping a bunch of functions to the same funky switch and trying to remember which is which. I'd like to see someone like SimCore try a layout like this out.

### Wheel 4: GT wheel, but again: Sparco P310 + SimCore STD24-WS

Why: another button broken on the NSH Racing box. Also, the people who touch SimCore button boxes seem to love them.

What:
* Sparco P310
* SimCore STD24-WS

Purchased January 2021

Notes:
* I had to do a lot of thinking ahead of time to figure out what buttons should do what

Review: this thing is awesome. The details are better covered by Boosted Media and GT Greg so I'll just link to those.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNO8ie9zPR8&ab_channel=BoostedMedia
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrNrLi6QQew&ab_channel=GTGreg
It was a long wait but 100% worth it. I had to do a lot of planning to figure out what to label each button, because they will pre-print labels for all the functions you want and put them in the right place. I also wired up the physical buttons on the P310 afterwards (aka the "NOS 1" and "NOS 2" buttons).

This video from Jardier was very helpful for figuring out what functions I should map for ACC:
