# simrig-evolution

## Version 1.0

Timeline: 0 AD -> December 2017

Mood: it'd be cool to play Gran Turismo every once in a while.

Sim rig:
* Logitech Driving Force GT
* Computer desk

PC:
* Nah PS3

## Version 2.0

Timeline: December 2017-November 2019

Mood: it'd be cool to play iRacing every once in a while.

PC: 
* Intel i4590 processor
* 16 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives

Sim rig:
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* [+] Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* Coffee table + extra wood for mounting

## Version 2.1

Mood: Hey, I want to get back into autocrossing on the regular. I should set up a better rig so that I can do more iRacing in the offseason.

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 16 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* [+] Radeon RX580
* [+] Some SSD + brackets
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* [+] Wheelstand pro, but for a different wheel. Like, not the T300RS.
* [+] Ikea kid's chair
* [+] Some dining room chair (wayfair?)
* [+] a block of wood in front of the rear chair legs or something so the pedals wouldn't move that much

Images:
* ...


## Version 3.0: The SimRiggening

Mood: I'm sick of my pedals moving so much. I should get something that is more rigid. 

What I thought I'd buy: Playseat, maybe a Simetik K2
What I actually bought: SimLab GT1 Evo

PC:
* Intel i4590 processor
* 16 GB RAM
* Bunch of random hard drives
* Radeon RX580
* Some SSD + brackets
* 26" Samsung TV/monitor

Sim rig:
* Thrustmaster T300RS wheelbase
* Thrustmaster T300RS pedals
* SimLab GT1 Evo
* SimLab single monitor mount 


## MK V

Mood: This rig is nice, but my monitor hookup is pretty hokey and it would be nice to accessorize. I don't think I'll ever get triples.

What I thought I'd buy: 34" ultrawide 
What I actually bought: 34" ultrawide

## MK N

Mood: Ah fuck, the 34" LG doesn't really mount right to this SimLab single monitor mount. I'll return it and buy a single 32". I doubt I'm ever going to go triples but a 32" covers my bases.

What I returned: 34" ultrawide
What I then actually bought: 32" AOC CQ32G1
  
## MK N

Mood: OK, I don't think I'm going to get triples any time soon, but I probably will eventually. I should just buy the triple stand now, because SimLab is getting backordered really quickly, and that way I'm covered whenever I want to upgrade. Also, it will make it easier if the monitor is on the standalone mount.

What I bought: triple mount

## MK N

Mood: I'm hearing a lot about load cell pedals. These T300RS pedals aren't that great. I'll see about the Fanatec V3s.

What I thought I'd buy: Fanatec V3s
What I actually bought: Heusinkveld Sprints, because the V3s sold out really quickly.

## MK N

Mood: some quality of life stuff. No big upgrades, just some rig tidying. 

8GB Crucial RAM

USB hub

Puma shoes

Pro Race 2

PC shelf

Velcro strips
Velcro stickers


## MK N

Mood: it'd be cool to have a shifter. Hey, the Fanatec looks cool. I can go manual or sequential!

What I thought I'd buy: Fanatec SSQ 1.5
What I ordered: Fanatec SSQ 1.5
What I cancelled after two weeks of the order not moving: Fanatech SSQ 1.5
What I then ordered: Heusinkveld sequential shifter

## MK N

Mood: Dirt Rally is pretty awesome. I want a handbrake so I can stop using the circle button on my T300RS wheel.

What I ordered: Heusinkveld handbrake

## MK major version butmp

Mood: I want triples. Also, ACC is pretty cool but my PC pretty much sucks. Playing single screen 1080p ACC with 70% resolution scaling is basically like playing Gran Turismo 2. 

### Minor tweak

magnetic paddles

## MK major version bump

Mood: People with G25s are kicking my ass on a T300RS! I need a DD wheel. So that I can get more of a workout when people with G25s kick my ass. Which will continue to happen because I don't practice enough.

### Wheel 1: convert the T300RS


### Wheel 2: rally wheel


### Wheel 3: GT wheel

## MK next

Mood: I have no complaints about my setup, except it's just really dark. Everything is black.

What I did: painted seat orange at a local body shop

### Wheel 4: GT wheel, but again
